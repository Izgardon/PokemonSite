Pokemon site

To run, pull down the repo and run 'npm install' inside the folder and then 'npm run serve' to open on port 8080.

You can search for pokemon from the original 151, and filter based on their type or color. The pokemon data is cached along with the image url using local storage



**Dev Notes**
.env file is being pushed but would normally be hidden, just for ease of testing
